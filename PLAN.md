# MediCore HMS — Rebuild Plan

TypeScript MERN Stack rebuild of the Hospital Management System.

**Stack:** Node.js + Express + TypeScript + MongoDB (Mongoose) + React 18 + Redux Toolkit + TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui + Socket.io + Zod

**Architecture:** Module-based backend (`schema → service → controller → router`), shared RBAC via `authorize.ts` permission matrix, MongoMemoryServer integration tests with supertest, React Query v5 frontend.

## Phase 0 — Pre-Migration & Foundation ✅

- [x] Consolidate auth — merge `doctors`, `nurses`, `users` collections into single `users` collection with `role` field
- [x] Delete legacy always-true auth middleware (`checkAccess.js`, `checkAdmin.js`)
- [x] Delete legacy `communication.js` (superseded by Notification model)
- [x] TypeScript backend scaffold (`tsconfig.json`, strict mode, path aliases)
- [x] Frontend TypeScript + Vite config
- [x] Docker multi-stage builds (backend + frontend)
- [x] Express app bootstrap: Helmet CSP, CORS from env, Redis rate limiter
- [x] Socket.io with JWT handshake, Redis adapter, `user:{id}` rooms, role rooms
- [x] AuditLog model (append-only, actorId, resourceType, before/after diffs)
- [x] Migration script `001-consolidate-auth.ts`
- [x] `.gitignore` with `.worktrees/` and `.superpowers/` exclusions

---

## Phase 1 — Auth & JWT ✅

- [x] `User` model — single collection, roles: `admin | doctor | nurse | receptionist | patient`

- [x] `authenticate` middleware — JWT Bearer token validation, attaches `req.user`
- [x] `authorize` middleware — RBAC permission matrix (`resource × role → Permission`)
- [x] Auth integration tests (register, login, refresh, logout, token reuse attack)
- [x] Frontend: login/register pages, Redux auth slice, `ProtectedRoute` component
- [x] Frontend: JWT refresh interceptor, persistent auth via `localStorage`

---

---

## Phase 4 — Billing ✅

- [x] `Invoice` model — `INV-XXXX` auto-ID, line items, tax/discount/total computed pre-save, payments array, status lifecycle (`draft → issued → partial | paid | overdue | void`)
- [x] Pre-save hook: computes subtotal, tax, total, amountPaid, balance; auto-updates status
- [x] Billing routes: create draft, list, get, issue, record payment, void
- [x] RBAC: receptionist `read+write`, admin `all` (issue/void admin-only), patient `own-read`
- [x] Billing integration tests (13 tests)
- [x] Frontend types (`frontend/src/types/billing.ts`)
- [x] Frontend: patient billing list + invoice detail pages
- [x] Frontend: admin/receptionist billing management page (create, issue, pay, void dialogs)
- [x] `StatusBadge` component extended with billing statuses
- [x] Sidebar: split billing nav by role

---

## Phase 5 — Lab & Diagnostics ✅

- [x] `LabOrder` model — `LAB-XXXX` auto-ID, patient/doctor refs, tests array (name/code/status per test), priority (`routine | urgent | stat`), order status lifecycle
- [x] `LabResult` model — 1 per order (unique), results array (value/unit/referenceRange/isNormal), technician ref, verifiedBy Doctor ref, status (`preliminary | final | amended`), reportUrl
- [x] Status transition guard — terminal states (`completed`, `cancelled`) cannot be reversed
- [x] Lab routes: create order, list orders, get order, update status, enter results, get results, verify result
- [x] RBAC: doctor `read+write`, nurse `read`, admin `all`, patient `own-read`, receptionist `false`
- [x] Lab integration tests (16 tests)
- [x] Frontend types (`frontend/src/types/lab.ts`)
- [x] Frontend: patient lab results list + detail pages
- [x] Frontend: doctor lab orders page (create, inline detail, verify result)
